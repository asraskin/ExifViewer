the option of saving the information to a KML file.</p>

<p>Modified the Viewer to handle the change in behaviour in the beta versions of

output area to increase indefinitely, rather than leaving the width as is and 
displaying a scroll bar; also fixed a problem with expanding and collapsing the 
IPTC Core lists caused by a change in the tagnames for HTML elements. Verified
that everything still works in beta 4.</p>

GPS latitude/longitude data.</p>

<h2>Version 1.06 - December 19, 2006 - 51 KB</h2>

eliminate some of the problems reported here.</p>
